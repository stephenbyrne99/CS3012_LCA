 * 1. Choose a unit testing framework.
 * 2. Create a repository on a git service such as Github. 
 * 3. Define a set of initial unit tests that capture the basic expected behaviour. 
 * 		This will require you to create sample data and also to identify the basic API for your solution.
 * 4. Build your initial solution, testing it against your test code until it is working.
 * 5. Refine the solution, expanding your test cases to deal with awkward parameters and edge cases that 
 * 		push the limits of your solution, enhancing your solution to deal with these.
